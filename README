Application Workspaces for GNOME Shell
===

An extension that causes new application windows to be placed in an empty
workspace.  This is designed for netbook devices where the screen is physically
small and input devices are bad, so window management is best avoided.

This is very much proof of concept, notable problems being with the Empathy
roster and chat windows.

To install it for all users:

  sudo make install.

To install it for the current user:

  make install-local

To activate the extension you'll need to reload the shell, this is done by activating the
Run dialog (Alt-F2 by default) and entering "restart".
